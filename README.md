# TheVault
This an app created for android users and can be used as a password manager by an individual.

This app is called TheVault which uses Google's Firebase API to store certain passwords and create a sign in and sign up verification method. 

This app also features a comfortable user interface that will not take a toll over the eyes of the user and will provide a better overall experience. 

This Password manager was made using [Thunkable](thunkable.com "Thunkable")

Thunkable is a web app just like MIT App Inventor that uses blocks to make the interface friendly for a person who has just started programming.

But the good thing about it is that it can also be used to make iOS version alongside the android version itself
